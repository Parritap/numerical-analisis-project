              subsequent chapters and these are explored in examples and case
              studies. Simple examples are the polynomials in Table 2.2. The
              Chebyshev polynomials {\$}{\$}T{\_}{\{}n{\}}(x){\$}{\$}Tn(x)have
              roots whose locations are known, whereas the Legendre polynomials {
